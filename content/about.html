<p>I am a UK-trained medical doctor with a speciality in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine from Australia. I have worked for <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk">MSF UK</a> since 2014 as a tuberculosis (TB), HIV and viral hepatitis specialist. Aside from an emergency secondment to support the organisation during the West African Ebola outbreak, my operational attention has been predominantly on drug-resistant tuberculosis and the Eastern European and Central Asian countries of the WHO Euro region. Since the beginning of 2019, I have also led MSF’s technical TB working group - a role that has required a greater focus on exernal relations, advocacy and global policy and research.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about access to healthcare, people-centredness and the bioethical concepts of equity and justice. In the field of TB, I work hard to improve our knowledge on the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB.</p>
<p>Aside from my clinical and epidemiological interests in TB, I am also improving my skills in data processing, analysis and visualisation. This has been a natural progression from my MSc and the frequent use of programmatic data in my current roles.</p>
<p>In addition to my medical degree from <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>, I am also a Fellow of the <a href="https://www.racp.edu.au">Royal Australasian College of Physicians</a>. I was awarded a Diploma of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&amp;H) by the <a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk">Royal College of Physicians</a> and have completed a MSc in Epidmiology at the <a href="http://www.lshtm.ac.uk">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>.</p>
