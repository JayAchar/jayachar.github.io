<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been working with an analysis that I first started 3 years ago. The study
was accepted for an international conference late last year and some of the questions that came
up from the audience rekindled my ambition of improving on the original analysis.</p>
<p>This study represented my first analysis performed solely with R after having learnt to use Stata
earlier in my research career. For that reason, I have a little nostalgia towards this particular piece,
but more importantly, it means the analysis isn’t structured in a way that helps revitalisation!</p>
<p>When looking at the scripts, folders and raw data, it’s clear that while the analysis has structure,
it’s not intuitive when scanning with new eyes. The poor documentation adds to the sense
that the work was designed for only one reader: myself in 2017.</p>
<p>So, this blog post represents some of the key lessons I’ve been schooled on as I’ve tried to get
this three year old analysis to run again.</p>
<p>Clone or fork <a href="https://www.github.com/JayAchar/blog-reproduce" target="_blank">this repo</a> if you
would like some sample code that I’ll refer to through this post.</p>

<h1>Reproducibility in research</h1>
<p>The question of <em>‘Why do we need reproducibility in research?’</em> should be fairly obvious, but for
many, I don’t the answers are taken particularly seriously. That may be because they have never
needed to return to an analysis to update or re-run, or because they lack the knowledge to fully
implement it.</p>
<p>As time goes on, I’m relooking at more and more analyses and, thankfully, recognising that my
ability in R is much better than it was. Where documentation and dependency management is well
organised, I can quickly re-run, adjust or refactor an analysis to answer questions from colleagues
or reviewers.</p>
