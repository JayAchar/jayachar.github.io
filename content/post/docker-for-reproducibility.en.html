<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been working with an analysis that I first started 3 years ago. The study
was accepted for an international conference late last year and some of the questions that came
up from the audience rekindled my ambition of improving on the original analysis.</p>
<p>This study represented my first analysis performed solely with R after having learnt to use Stata
earlier in my research career. For that reason, I have a little nostalgia towards this particular piece,
but more importantly, it means the analysis isn’t structured in a way that helps revitalisation!</p>
<p>When looking at the scripts, folders and raw data, it’s clear that while the analysis has structure,
it’s not intuitive when scanning with new eyes. The poor documentation adds to the sense
that the work was designed for only one reader: myself in 2017.</p>
<p>So, this blog post represents some of the key lessons I’ve been schooled on as I’ve tried to get
this three year old analysis to run again.</p>
<p>Clone or fork <a href="https://www.github.com/JayAchar/blog-reproduce" target="_blank">this repo</a> if you
would like some sample code that I’ll refer to through this post.</p>
<div id="reproducibility-in-research" class="section level1">
<h1>Reproducibility in research</h1>
<p>The question of <em>‘Why do we need reproducibility in research?’</em> should be fairly obvious.
In my case, lack of knowledge was initially the barrier to addressing this, but soon enough I realised
that the process was much easier than I had thought.</p>
<p>My motivation for learning about some aspects of reproducibility in research and then moving on to
work with some of tools available, came from returning to analyses that I had run in the past.
As time goes on, I’m relooking at more and more analyses and, thankfully, recognising that my
ability in R is much better than it was. Where documentation and dependency management is well
organised, I’m able to quickly re-run, adjust or refactor an analysis to answer questions from colleagues
or reviewers.</p>
<p>Some of other aspects of reproducibility in statistical analyses that I won’t cover here include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Version control,</li>
<li>Transparency in code development,</li>
<li>Relative paths in code,</li>
<li>Unit testing,</li>
<li>Continuous integration</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="dependencies" class="section level1">
<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>One of the biggest challenges with revisiting code that worked in the past is the inevitable updating
of dependencies. <strong>Dependencies are additional resources that your code requires to run correctly</strong>. When
discussing R analyses, the most obvious examples are the packages of functions we regularly incorporate
into our interactive workflow. Think <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>,
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html">car</a>
and maybe <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html">rmarkdown</a>.</p>
<p>When dependencies are updated, functions may change their behaviour, require different arguments as inputs,
or stop existing altogether.</p>
<p>In software development, professional programmers manage this issue by working within a <strong><em>development
environment</em></strong> that defines exact versions of all dependencies.</p>
<p>One of the most popular tools, <a href="https://www.docker.com">docker</a>, is freely available for all, is able
to run on all operating systems, has numerous online resources to learn and debug problems and a
<a href="https://hub.docker.com">repository</a> of <em>images</em> which save users time and effort.</p>
</div>
<div id="building-a-docker-image" class="section level1">
<h1>Building a docker image</h1>
<p>Docker works using concepts of <strong><em>images</em></strong> and <strong><em>containers</em></strong>. I won’t go into details about docker
here, but there are lots of resources, including the
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/">official documentation</a>, to help understand
the way docker works. If you’re interested in developing your own custom images, then I would
recommend reading the documentation, blog posts and also YouTube videos relating to your exact use
csae.</p>
<p>Very briefly, a docker <strong>image</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>is <strong>built</strong> once from a template file,</li>
<li>incorporates all files relevant for the purpose of the image</li>
<li>can be rebuilt when changes are required</li>
</ul>
<p>While, a docker <strong>container</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>runs an instance of image</li>
<li>performs the tasks set out in the image build</li>
<li>can be stopped and restarted to duplicate tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>So, when we build an <strong>image</strong>, we can define versions of the code and its dependencies so that
the results of running the <strong>container</strong> are predicatable and reproducable.</p>
<div id="dockerfile" class="section level2">
<h2>Dockerfile</h2>
<p>Within the folder containing your R project, create a file called <em>Dockerfile</em> - the spelling’s
important and there should be no file extension.</p>
<p>This is the template which will be <strong>built</strong> into our analysis image. The file is based on exact
syntax so be precise. Either in your command line editor, or other code editor open start editing
the Dockerfile.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># versioned R distribution with tidyverse and Rstudio installed
FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.5.1</code></pre>
<p>Our analysis-specific image will add our specific needs to the
<a href="https://www.rocker-project.org/images/">rocker/tidyverse</a> image. Including the version tag
ensures that the image will be built with the version of R and that all installed packages
will be versioned to work with this R-version.</p>
<p>Create an additional R-script within your project folder which will install all of the packages
requried by your analysis. The base image above includes all packages included in the <code>tidyverse</code>,
so no need to re-install them at this stage. This R-script should be similar to any other R code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install packages into analysis Docker image
install.packages(&quot;car&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then add the following lines to your Dockerfile to ensure this file is added to the docker image
along with all files from your analysis <code>R</code> folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># define additional packages to install
ADD ./packages.R /tmp/packages.R
# add analysis scripts
ADD ./R /home/rstudio_user/R</code></pre>
<p>In the next few lines of the Dockerfile, we’ll create an analysis output folder and a data
folder before installing all of the packages we defined in the <code>packages.R</code> file.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># add output folder
RUN mkdir /home/rstudio_user/output
# add raw data folder
RUN mkdir /home/rstudio_user/raw
# install packages
RUN Rscript /tmp/packages.R</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="build-image" class="section level2">
<h2>Build image</h2>
<p>The next step is to build the analysis image using the command below. This one needs to be entered
into your command line terminal - <code>terminal</code> on Mac OS X or <code>Command Prompt</code> on Windows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># navigate to your analysis folder where your Dockerfile is saved
cd &lt;&lt;analysis-folder&gt;&gt;
# build the image using the docker engine
docker build -t my-analysis-image .</code></pre>
<p>Don’t miss the full stop at the end of the build command - the command won’t work without it.</p>
<p>All being well, the docker engine will take some time to download and unpack the necessary
files then end with message confirming a successful build.</p>
<p>To check that you image has been built successfully, you can use the command <code>docker images</code>
to output a list of all of your computer’s docker images. Confirm that your named image
<code>my-analysis-image</code> is present.</p>
</div>
<div id="start-container" class="section level2">
<h2>Start container</h2>
<p>Now we have our image, it’s time to start a container:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># start container
docker run -d --name my_container \
        -v &lt;&lt;add_your_data_folder_path_here&gt;&gt;:/home/rstudio_user/raw \
        -v &lt;&lt;add_your_analysis_output_folder_here&gt;&gt;:/home/rstudio_user/output \
        -p 8787:8787 \
        -e PASSWORD=test1234 \
        -e USER=rstudio_user \
        my-analysis-image</code></pre>
<p>This command will start a docker container using the image you have defined in your Dockerfile.
The container includes a RStudio server with the username - <code>rstudio_user</code> - and password - <code>test1234</code> -<br />
defined in the run command.</p>
<p>In your internet browser, navigate to <a href="http://localhost::8787"><code>http://localhost::8787</code></a> where
a Rstudio login page should allow you to enter the necessary credentials. The RStudio session
should include a <code>R</code> folder containing your analysis scripts.</p>
<p>Your raw data should be available in the <code>raw</code> folder and can be adjusted as required. Raw data stays on
your computer here, as does any outputs from the analysis.</p>
<p>When you’ve completed your analysis, log out of the RStudio session and head back to your command line
to shutdown the docker container</p>
<pre class="r"><code># stop the analysis container
docker stop my_container</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This approach of packaging your R code into a docker image should ensure that your analysis is
both reproducible and transferable to other computers. The image I’ve described is quite simple
and could be improved upon both in terms of functionality as well as size. However, the purpose
of this post was to describe a relatively simple workflow to encourage you to incorporate this final
step into your analysis process.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have suggestions for improving the docker image and do try out the example code in
the <a href="https://www.github.com/JayAchar/blog-reproduce">Github repo</a>.</p>
