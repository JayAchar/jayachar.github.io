<h2>What is propensity matching for?</h2>
<p>Propensity matching is a technique used primarily for the analysis of observational study data. In non-randomised studies, treatment is frequently allocated based on certain characteristics of participants. For example, where a drug is considered to cause more side-effects, it may not be given to older participants by clinicians. This is a concept called <strong>confounding</strong> where a third variable is associated with both the outcome and the explanatory variable of a study question. Participant age may be a confounding characteristic in a study investigating the effect of an HIV treatment regimen on viral suppression for example.</p>
