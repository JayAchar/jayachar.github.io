<h3>Employment</h3>

MSF International Tuberculosis Working Group Leader
</p>
<p class="cv-detail">
Manson Unit, Médecins Sans Frontières UK - 2019 to present
</p>
<p>Within this role, I take responsiblity for coordinating technical advisors for TB across the organisation, justifying and proposing the organisation’s strategic direction, representing MSF in our advocacy messaging and at external meetings and committees, while also supporting colleagues on research topics, resource allocation and development of cross-sectional dossiers.</p>
<p class="cv-header">
TB/HIV/Hepatitis and Research Programme Advisor
</p>
<p class="cv-detail">
Manson Unit, Médecins Sans Frontières UK - 2015 to present
</p>
<p>When I joined MSF, this was the job I dreamt of holding. Over the years, I’ve gained field experience in Belarus, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, South Sudan, DR Congo, and Sierra Leone, mixing short strategic visits with longer more comprehensive field support.</p>
<p>The job also requires justification and planning of a wider portfolio of TB across one section of MSF both through a technical medical and humanitarian lens.</p>
<p>The strong implementation focus of the position requires strengths in field support, guideline development, research methodology and execution as well as important advocacy roles within policy and technical committees.</p>
