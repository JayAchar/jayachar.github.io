# What do I do?

My name is Jay Achar. I am a UK-trained medical doctor with a speciality in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine from Australia. I have worked for [MSF UK](http://www.msf.org.uk) since 2014 as a tuberculosis (TB), HIV and viral hepatitis specialist. Aside from an emergency secondment to support the organisation during the West African Ebola outbreak, my operational attention has been predominantly on drug-resistant tuberculosis and the Eastern European and Central Asian  countries of the WHO Euro region. 

I'm passionate about access to healthcare, people-centredness and the bioethical concepts of equity and justice. In the field of TB, I work hard to improve our knowledge on the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB. 

In addition to my medical degree from [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk), I am also a Fellow of the [Royal Australasian College of  Physicians](https://www.racp.edu.au). I was awarded a Diploma of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&H) by the [Royal College of Physicians](https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk) and have completed a MSc in Epidmiology at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk).
